# Assignment 1.1 - Breaking the web

## Summary
This assignment is about 'breaking' the web by disabling some features on the browser. The features that I had to disable are color and bandwidth.

## Color

### 1. Color blindness
Color blindness or dolor vision deficiency (CVD) affects around 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women worldwide. This means that for every 100 users that visit your website, up to 8 people could actually experience the content much differently than you would expect.

#### 1.1 Types of color blindness
Most color blind people are able to see things just as clearly as the rest of the population, the difference is their inability to distinguish red, green or blue light.

##### 1.1.1 Protanopia & Deuteranopia
The most common is red/green color blindness, where sufferers mix up all colors which have red or green as part of the whole color. Those affected by Protan color blindness are less sensitive to red light, whilst sufferers of Deuteranopia have the same problem with green. For example, a person with Protanopia will confuse blue and purple because they can’t recognize the red element of the color purple.

##### 1.1.2 Tritanopia 
The third type of color deficiency, Tritanopia, is the least common and refers to sufferers who struggle to distinguish blue or yellow light.

##### 1.1.3 What they perceive
The image below shows what the rainbow may look like to individuals with each of these forms of color blindness.

### 2. Tools
- [Colorblinding](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorblinding/dgbgleaofjainknadoffbjkclicbbgaa) is a Google Chrome extension to simulate color blindness.
- [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/designers/colorfilter/) is a website that simulates color blindness.

### 3. Examples

### 4. Tips for better color accessibility

#### 1. Use both colors and symbols
You shouldn’t rely on color alone to convey a message; for example, certain types of color blindness might make it difficult or even impossible to see common red error messages. One approach is to use both colors and symbols where users’ attention is required. A good example of this is Facebook’s form fields and the error messaging attached.

#### 2. Keep it minimal
You should limit the color palette you use for your website; the fewer colors you use in your design, the fewer instances there will be for confusion.

#### 3. Use patterns and textures to show contrast
Try to use different textures, as opposed to multiple colors, for elements that require emphasis. For example, it might be difficult for color blind users to interpret graphs and charts. In this case, it’s better to use contrasting patterns and, where possible, place text instead.

#### 4. Be careful with contrasting colors and hues
Instead of relying on black and white as your only contrasting colors; try to use a range of clearly contrasting colors and hues in your design. For example, the game Word Feud uses four colors for its tiles that can be easily distinguished by those with or without color vision deficiency.

#### 5. Avoid bad color combos
You need to be smart when picking out your color combinations. Since color blindness affects people in different ways, it’s difficult to determine which colors are ‘safe’ to use in web design. That being said, here’s a few color combinations to avoid because they’re a potential nightmare to color blind users:

- Green & Red
- Green & Brown
- Blue & Purple
- Green & Blue
- Light Green & Yellow
- Blue & Grey
- Green & Grey
- Green & Black
