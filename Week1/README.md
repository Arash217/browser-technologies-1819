# Assignment 1.1 - Breaking the web

## Summary
This assignment is about 'breaking' the web by disabling some features on the browser. 
The features that I had to disable/limit are color and bandwidth.

## 1. Color blindness
Color blindness affects around 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women worldwide. 
This means that for every 100 users that visit your website, 
up to 8 people could actually experience the content much differently. 
This could result the website being less usable or not usable at all for them, if not optimized.

### 1.1 Types of color blindness
Most color blind people are able to see things just as clearly as the rest of the population, the difference is their inability to distinguish red, green or blue light.

#### 1.1.1 Protanopia & Deuteranopia
The most common is red/green color blindness, where sufferers mix up all colors which have red or green as part of the whole color. Those affected by Protan color blindness are less sensitive to red light, whilst sufferers of Deuteranopia have the same problem with green.

#### 1.1.2 Tritanopia 
The third type of color deficiency, Tritanopia, is the least common and refers to sufferers who struggle to distinguish blue or yellow light.

#### 1.1.3 Monochromacy 
People with monochromatic vision can see no colour at all and their world consists of different shades of grey ranging from black to white.

#### 1.1.3 What they perceive
The image below shows what colors look like for color blind individuals.

### 2. Tools
- [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/designers/colorfilter/) is a website that simulates color blindness.
- [Colorblinding](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorblinding/dgbgleaofjainknadoffbjkclicbbgaa) is a Google Chrome extension that simulates color blindness.

### 3. Examples
- [ATG tickets](https://atg.nliven.co/tickets/series/wicked/wicked-103989?startDate=03-27-2019&_ga=2.180328228.1492796431.1552309213-323361853.1552309213#mapView) is not color friendly for any type of color blindness when buying a ticket. 
- [De Beren reservation](https://www.beren.nl/welkom/reserveer-online/?new=1&res=1&i=c84a127447a251b6d038b97aa86096725c31ba3a) is not color friendly for people with monochromacy when choosing a reservation time.
### 4. Tips for better color accessibility
- Donâ€™t only rely on color to convey a message
- Keep your color palette limited to 2 or 3 colors
- Use texture and patterns to show contrast
- Carefully select any contrasting colors and shades
- Avoid using bad color combinations

## 2. Low bandwidth
